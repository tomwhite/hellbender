Hellbender on Spark
================

[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing, and thanks to
[Spark Dataflow](https://github.com/cloudera/spark-dataflow), Hellbender can run on any Spark cluster, such as an
on-premise Hadoop cluster with HDFS storage and the Spark runtime. You can also use the Spark Dataflow Runner locally
for testing, without having to install Spark separately, or with a local standalone cluster running on your machine.

This document walks through all of these different scenarios.

Running Tests on Spark Dataflow
------------

To run tests against the Spark Dataflow runner set the `dataflowRunner` system property as follows:

```bash
gradle test -DdataflowRunner=SparkPipelineRunner
```

The tests create a local Spark cluster running in the JVM and use it to run the Hellbender Dataflow pipelines.

Running Hellbender Commands Locally on Spark Dataflow (Without a Cluster)
------------

This allows you to run Hellbender Dataflow command lines using Spark running in the local JVM. It is useful for testing
commands against local files using the Spark Dataflow runner.

First, [download](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html) and unpack the Spark tarball on your local machine.
Version 1.3.1 for Hadoop 2.6 is recommended.

For convenience, add Spark to your `PATH`:

```bash
export SPARK_HOME=/path/to/spark/installation
export PATH=$PATH:$SPARK_HOME/bin
```

The Hellbender build produces a JAR file that is suitable for running Spark jobs with (note that it differs from the
"fat JAR" that is used for running regular Hellbender commands). Build it with:

```bash
gradle clean shadowJar
```

You should see a JAR file in the _build/libs_ directory with a `-spark` extension.

Now you can run a pipeline using `spark-submit` in place of the regular `java -jar` invocation. For example, to run
the count reads program to count the number of reads in a BAM file, type the following:

```bash
spark-submit \
  build/libs/hellbender-all-*-spark.jar CountReadsDataflow \
    --input ./src/test/resources/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/flag_stat.bam \
    --output countreads \
    --runner SPARK
```

Notice that the Spark Dataflow runner was specified using the `--runner` argument.

You can inspect the output with

```bash
cat countreads*
```

Running Hellbender Commands on a Spark Cluster
------------

In this scenario, your input and output files reside on HDFS, and Spark will run in a distributed fashion on the cluster.
The Spark documentation has a good [overview of the architecture](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/cluster-overview.html).

Note that if you don't have a dedicated cluster you can run Spark in
[standalone mode](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-standalone.html) on a single machine, which exercises
the distributed code paths, albeit on a single node.

The first step is to copy a BAM file to HDFS, which can be achieved using the `hadoop` command as follows.

```bash
hadoop fs -put ./src/test/resources/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/flag_stat.bam flag_stat.bam
```

Next, run `spark-submit` again, but with a few extra configuration properties set, which are suitable for a cluster
environment:

```bash
NAMENODE=<hostname of the HDFS namenode>
SPARK_MASTER=yarn-client
spark-submit \
  --master $SPARK_MASTER \
  --conf spark.driver.userClassPathFirst=true \
  --conf spark.executor.userClassPathFirst=true \
  --conf spark.io.compression.codec=lzf \
  build/libs/hellbender-all-*-spark.jar CountReadsDataflow \
    --input hdfs://$NAMENODE/user/$USER/flag_stat.bam \
    --output hdfs://$NAMENODE/user/$USER/out/countreads \
    --runner SPARK \
    --sparkMaster $SPARK_MASTER
```

This requires a bit more explanation. The environment variables `NAMENODE` and `SPARK_MASTER` are used to tell the
Spark client where to find the cluster. `NAMENODE` is used to construct the HDFS paths for the `--input` and `--output`
arguments, and should point to the HDFS namenode in the cluster you are using.

`SPARK_MASTER` is used to tell the Spark client where to submit the job to. In this case we are running Spark on YARN,
so `yarn-client` is appropriate. You can find more about Spark master URLs
[here](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html#master-urls).

The `spark-submit` command takes arguments - and these go before the argument specifying the JAR file. In this case,
we've set some configuration variables: `spark.driver.userClassPathFirst` and `spark.executor.userClassPathFirst` are
set which means that our JAR file is put on the classpath ahead of the Spark and Hadoop JAR files and dependencies. We
need to do this so that we donâ€™t get conflicts with older library versions that Hadoop uses.

Also, the property `spark.io.compression.codec` is changed from its default `snappy`, since that can cause classloading
issues on some clusters. (Note that this setting is only for over-the-wire compression, not for file compression.)

When the command completes successfully you will see files in the `out` directory in HDFS:

```bash
hadoop fs -ls -R out/countreads*
```

You can inspect the output with

```bash
hadoop fs -cat out/countreads*
```

### Adjusting the Number of Executors and Memory Settings

For pipelines running on large datasets (such as typical BAM files), you will need to adjust the number of Spark
executors and the amount of memory that each executor uses. For example, the following runs a pipeline on 24 executors
each with two cores and 4GB of memory:

```bash
NAMENODE=<hostname of the HDFS namenode>
SPARK_MASTER=yarn-client
spark-submit \
  --master $SPARK_MASTER \
  --driver-memory 3G \
  --num-executors 24 \
  --executor-cores 2 \
  --executor-memory 3G \
  --conf spark.driver.userClassPathFirst=true \
  --conf spark.executor.userClassPathFirst=true \
  --conf spark.io.compression.codec=lzf \
  --conf spark.shuffle.io.preferDirectBufs=false \
  build/libs/hellbender-all-*-spark.jar CountReadsDataflow \
    --input hdfs://$NAMENODE/user/$USER/bam/NA12877_S1.bam \
    --output hdfs://$NAMENODE/user/$USER/out/countreads \
    --runner SPARK \
    --sparkMaster $SPARK_MASTER
```
